# feelingsbynumbers

A project inspired by data humanism, connecting our experiences on the y-axis of feelings and thoughts using the universal x-axis of time

This project was inspired by the Creator Conference held by Data Science by Design @DataScixDesign in Spring 2021 and the talk by Giorgia Lupi on Data Humanism, http://giorgialupi.com/

As a psychologist and person who has received mental health treatment since childhood, I get frustrated by how we simplify complex experiences into numbers.  I have both read my own medical records where a lot of suffering is put into a few scores and a checklist and done the same thing to other people as an effort to help.

This talk and conference inspired me to try to use this reductive system to celebrate individual experiences and connect people in using the power of the internet and graphs!

The idea is to have a form interface where people can rate their emotional experience and then have that experience visually  represented (using ggplot), both on its own and in the context of other people.  Because what was a boring day for me may have been the best day ever or the worst day ever for someone else.
